## Definition of resilience indicators for materials and components
---

*This task will identify the requirements of resilient components/systems for multi-hazard facades and load-bearing structures by investigating the impact of the considered hazards on the performance and functionality loss of the faÃ§ade/structure in time (from the hazard event to the full recovery) and estimating the cost and the environmental impact of the potential recovery scenarios. Bespoken resilience indicators will be defined to provide quantitative metrics that can be used to compare alternative solutions and quantify their impact in terms of resilience.*[^1]
## Questions

1. What is [Building-Performance](Building-Performance.md) and How is it measured?
2. What are the considered [Hazards](Hazards.md)? 
	1. How do they impact [Building-Facade](Building-Facade.md), and [Load-Bearing-Structures](Load-Bearing-Structures.md)?
	2. What is the Financial Impact?
	3. What is the Environmental Impact?
	4. What are some recovery scenarios?
4. What is [Resilience](../Notes/Resilience.md)?
	1. What are some indicators?
	2. How can they be quantified, analyzed, and compared?
5. What are [Multi-Hazard-Resilient-Components](Multi-Hazard-Resilient-Components.md)?
6. What are [Multi-Hazard-Resilient-Systems](Multi-Hazard-Resilient-Systems.md)?
