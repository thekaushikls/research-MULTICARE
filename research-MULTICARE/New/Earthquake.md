## About

An earthquake is a [Natural Hazard](Hazards.md#natural-hazards) (disaster) caused by sudden release of strain energy between the tectonic plates on the earth's crust[^1] causing tremors, vibrations, landslides, etc.

!!! tip 
	The scientific study of earthquakes, and the propagation of seismic waves within the Earth is called [Seismology](Seismology.md).

The origin of the movement is called the `Focus` or `Hypocenter` of the earthquake. The vibrations travel outward, causing (wave-like) disturbance across all directions from the epicenter causing damage to lives, ecosystems, properties, 

!!! question "How is Hypocenter different from Epicenter?"

	 **Hypocenter** is the point at which the earthquake originates, in 3D space. The vibrations travel in all 3 dimensions (6 directions).
	
	**Epicenter** is the hypocenter when projected onto the surface of the planet for mapping purposes. The impact is not measured in the depth dimension, rather the XY-Plane of the (Mercator)projection.

As one moves away from the Hypocenter, the (seismic)wave is dampened, and hence the intensity of damage is also reduced.

## Impacts

An earthquake is a dangerous natural hazard / disaster, and can cause a multitude of damage to [Structures](Earthquake-Impact-on-Structures.md), [Environment](Earthquake-Impact-on-Environment.md), and the [Economy](Earthquake-Impact-on-Economy.md).

1. Environmental Impacts
	1. Soil Liquefaction
2. Structural Impacts
	1. Sway
	2. Deformation
	3. Twisting
	4. Brittle failure (Load Bearing Structures)
	5. Ductile Failure (RCC Structures)
