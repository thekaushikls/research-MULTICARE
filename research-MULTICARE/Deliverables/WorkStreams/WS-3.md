**WORK PACKAGES:** [WP-3.1](../WorkPackages/WP-3.1.md) <br>
**TASKS:** [T-3.1.1](../Tasks/T-3.1.1.md), [T-3.1.2](../Tasks/T-3.1.2.md), [T-3.1.3](../Tasks/T-3.1.3.md)

## About

This workstream focusses on developing [Decision Support Frameworks](../../Notes/Decision%20Support%20Frameworks.md) and a suite of [Digital Tools](../../Notes/Digital%20Tools.md) to achieve [Resilience](../../Notes/Resilience.md) and [Environmental Sustainability](../../Notes/Environmental%20Sustainability.md).

These frameworks and tools, collectively aim to achieve the below purposes. for both new construction, as well as existing structures via retrofitting.

1. Access multi-hazard resilience.
2. Impact of multi-hazard resilience at multiple levels
	1. [Material Level Performance](../../Notes/Material%20Level%20Performance.md)
	2. [Component Level Performance](../../Notes/Component%20Level%20Performance.md)
	3. [Building Level Performance](../../Notes/Building%20Level%20Performance.md)
	4. [Urban Level Performance](../../Notes/Urban%20Level%20Performance.md)
3. Define effective adaptation systems
4. Aim to achieve targeted level of resilience and environmental sustainability
5. Aid in making informed decisions about
	1. Multi-Performance
	2. Cost-Effectiveness
6. Focusses on both new construction and retrofitting existing structures.
